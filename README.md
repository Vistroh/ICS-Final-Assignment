# ICS Final Asssignment
This project attempts to show natural selection by having "fish" who will detect both the player(predator) and food. They will try to avoid the predator and will try to eat the food. Once a fish eats a piece of food it will die and reproduce a new fish. This new fish will have a chance to be fast, slower, or the same speed. It is the players job to try and eat the fish before they become too fast due to natural selection for the player to catch.
